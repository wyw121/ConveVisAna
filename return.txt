Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but

Schema 名称: Verdicts

提示词前 800 字符:
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is     
relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk'        
(ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.

**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON       
format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all
strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output  
it.

Expected JSON format:

Given the answer relevancy score, the list of reasons of irrelevant
statements made in the actual output, and the input, provide a CONCISE reason
